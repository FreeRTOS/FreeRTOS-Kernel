# Examples of using the FreeRTOS-Kernel in isolation

1. You can find how to include proper paths and files to successfully build the kernel using CMake in [cmake_example](./cmake_example/) directory.
2. Example on how to run Coverity Static Analysis on the kernel using CMake can be found in [coverity](./coverity) directory.
3. Template configuration file for the kernel (FreeRTOSConfig.h) can be found in [template_configuration](./template_configuration) directory.


### Additional examples

You can find examples of how to use FreeRTOS-Kernel on different microcontrollers [here](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS/tree/main/FreeRTOS/Demo).

Additional examples of the kernel being used in real life applications in tandem with many other libraries (i.e. FreeRTOS+TCP, coreMQTT, coreHTTP etc.) can be found [here](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS/tree/main/FreeRTOS-Plus/Demo).
